- üòã **Emoji Representation**: Instead of the full-fledged visual representation, this shorter CLI variant uses delightful emojis to depict the breakfast stages. Good to visually distinct the versions during an update.
- üì¶ **Container Name Display**: Just like the HTTP version, the shorter CLI response showcases the name of the container serving the request, offering an extra layer of information for the curious minds.



## Usage

Deploying and using Breakfast can be achieved in different environments. Here are step-by-step guides for Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.

### Deploying on Kubernetes

Deploying the Breakfast application on Kubernetes is straightforward. Follow the steps below to get it up and running in your cluster.

</a>
</p>

**Commands Used in the Video**:

```bash
# Create a Deployment object with 10 replicas
kubectl create deploy breakfast --image=evryn/breakfast:1.2.1 --port=8080 --replicas=10

# Expose it as a NodePort service
kubectl expose deploy breakfast --name=breakfast-svc --type=NodePort --target-port=8080
```

To get the service URL to view the Breakfast app in your browser or through the command line, use the following:

```bash
URL=$(minikube service breakfast-svc --url) && echo $URL && sleep 2 && \
while true; do curl --connect-timeout 1 -sS "$URL?short=true"; sleep 0.5; done
```

To observe changes in the deployed application, you can update the image version or other deployment settings:

```bash
kubectl set image deploy/breakfast breakfast=evryn/breakfast:2.0.0
```

### Deploying on Docker Swarm

If you're using Docker Swarm, the deployment process has its own set of commands. Here's how to deploy and access the Breakfast app:

</a>
</p>

**Commands Used in the Video**:

```bash
# Deploy the service with 10 replicas
docker service create --name breakfast --replicas 10 --publish 8080:8080 evryn/breakfast:0.3.1
```

To access the Breakfast app, navigate to your node IP followed by the port `8080`. If you're on localhost, it's as simple as visiting `127.0.0.1:8080`. For a CLI version:

```bash
while true; do curl --connect-timeout 1 -sS "127.0.0.1:8080?short=true"; sleep 0.5; done
```

To make modifications to the currently deployed service, you can update the image or other service settings:

```bash
docker service update breakfast --image evryn/breakfast:1.0.0
```

## Customization

If you wish to tailor the Breakfast project according to your needs or simply want to play around with its content, the process is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Fork the Project**:
   Begin by forking the repository. This gives you your own copy to work with.

2. **Modify the Templates**:
   Navigate to the `templates` directory. The files in this directory use Go Template syntax. You can modify the content as per your requirements.

3. **Add Static Content**:
   If you have assets like images, CSS, or JavaScript that need to be served statically, place them in the `static` directory.

4. **Update Configuration**:
   Make changes to the `config.yaml` as needed.

   _Important: Ensure that you list versions in ascending order for proper registry tagging._

5. **Deployment Workflow**:
   A workflow is provided to build and upload the versioned images to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Github Registry](https://ghcr.io), and [Quay.io](https://quay.io).
   For authentication and to ensure the correct credentials are used, check the `.github/workflows/build.yaml`. This workflow is triggered manually from your repository's Actions tab.

By following the steps above, everything should work seamlessly out-of-the-box. Enjoy customizing and deploying your own versions of Breakfast!
