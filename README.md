Send a request to `/` to get:
- üçΩÔ∏è **Visual Breakfast Progress**: Experience the evolution of a Persian breakfast table, represented through dynamic visual stages. This is not just eye-catching, but it aligns closely with the varied deployment phases you'd encounter in real-world applications - either a major update, a feature addition or a bugfix.
- üåê **Ingress Host Display**: You can use different ingress options to direct the request to Breakfast. We'll show you how the final request got into the container.
- üì¶ **Container Name Display**: Want to see which container handles the request during a deployment update? We'll show you the container name.


#### CLI-friendly Page:
Send a request to `/?short=true` to get:
- üòã **Emoji Representation**: Instead of the full-fledged visual representation, this shorter CLI variant uses delightful emojis to depict the breakfast stages. Good to visually distinct the versions during an update.
- üì¶ **Container Name Display**: Just like the HTTP version, the shorter CLI response showcases the name of the container serving the request, offering an extra layer of information for the curious minds.

</p>

**Commands Used in the Video**:

```bash
# Create a Deployment object with 10 replicas
kubectl create deploy breakfast --image=evryn/breakfast:1.2.1 --port=8080 --replicas=10

# Expose it as a NodePort service
kubectl expose deploy breakfast --name=breakfast-svc --type=NodePort --target-port=8080
```

To get the service URL to view the Breakfast app in your browser or through the command line, use the following:

```bash
URL=$(minikube service breakfast-svc --url) && echo $URL && sleep 2 && \
while true; do curl --connect-timeout 1 -sS "$URL?short=true"; sleep 0.5; done
```

To observe changes in the deployed application, you can update the image version or other deployment settings:

```bash
kubectl set image deploy/breakfast breakfast=evryn/breakfast:2.0.0
```

### Deploying on Docker Swarm

If you're using Docker Swarm, the deployment process has its own set of commands. Here's how to deploy and access the Breakfast app:

</p>

**Commands Used in the Video**:

```bash
# Deploy the service with 10 replicas
docker service create --name breakfast --replicas 10 --publish 8080:8080 evryn/breakfast:0.3.1
```

To access the Breakfast app, navigate to your node IP followed by the port `8080`. If you're on localhost, it's as simple as visiting `127.0.0.1:8080`. For a CLI version:

```bash
while true; do curl --connect-timeout 1 -sS "127.0.0.1:8080?short=true"; sleep 0.5; done
```

To make modifications to the currently deployed service, you can update the image or other service settings:

```bash
docker service update breakfast --image evryn/breakfast:1.0.0
```
